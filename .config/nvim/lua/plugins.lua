-- NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).
return {
    "tpope/vim-sleuth", -- Detect tabstop and shiftwidth automatically

    -- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
    -- with the first argument being the link and the following
    -- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
    --
    -- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
    --
    --  This is equivalent to:
    --    require('Comment').setup({})

    -- "gc" to comment visual regions/lines
    { "numToStr/Comment.nvim", opts = {} },

    -- NOTE: Plugins can specify dependencies.
    --
    -- The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well - anything
    -- you do for a plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.
    --
    -- Use the `dependencies` key to specify the dependencies of a particular plugin

    -- The following two comments only work if you have downloaded the kickstart repo, not just copy pasted the
    -- init.lua. If you want these files, they are in the repository, so you can just download them and
    -- place them in the correct locations.

    -- NOTE: Next step on your Neovim journey: Add/Configure additional plugins for Kickstart
    --
    --  Here are some example plugins that I've included in the Kickstart repository.
    --  Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them (you will need to restart nvim).
    --
    -- require 'kickstart.plugins.debug',
    -- require 'kickstart.plugins.indent_line',
    -- require 'kickstart.plugins.lint',
    -- require 'kickstart.plugins.autopairs',
    -- require 'kickstart.plugins.neo-tree',
    -- require 'kickstart.plugins.gitsigns', -- adds gitsigns recommend keymaps

    -- NOTE: The import below can automatically add your own plugins, configuration, etc from `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua`
    --    This is the easiest way to modularize your config.
    --
    --  Uncomment the following line and add your plugins to `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua` to get going.
    --    For additional information, see `:help lazy.nvim-lazy.nvim-structuring-your-plugins`
    -- { import = 'custom.plugins' },
