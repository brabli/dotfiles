# brabli's Dotfiles

All the cool kids have a dotfiles repository, so as a cool kid myself I found it fitting to create my own.

# Installation

I'm using [gnu stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) as a mechanism for installing my dotfiles. Install `stow` and clone this repository into your home directory.

From inside this directory run `stow .` to create symlinks in your home directory to the files in this dotfiles repo.
