# brabli's dotfiles

All the cool kids have a dotfiles repository, so as a cool kid myself I found it fitting to create my own.

# Usage

> Make sure `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set to `$HOME/.config`.

I'm using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage my dotfiles and [just](https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#private-recipes) to run the necessary commands.

After installing both `just` and `stow` you can run `just` by itself inside this directory to get an overview of the available commands.

# Additional Tools

Some other programs are required in order to make full use of these dotfiles.

These tools include but are not necessarily limited to:

- [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)
